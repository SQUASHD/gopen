# Gopen

**A simple CLI to quick-start coding projects**

The premise of this command-line utility is to have a list of aliases for your
local development projects instead of "polluting" your system configs (e.g.,
`.bashrc`). Then, Gopen command will `cd` into that folder and open your editor
of choice.
